The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on TourSmile, aiming to transform it into an AI-powered travel platform. Initial efforts focused on fixing UI bugs and integrating external APIs. The primary challenge revolved around flight and hotel API reliability:  and  were unreliable, leading to  integration attempts.  failed due to marketplace-specific endpoint and authentication issues, prompting its cancellation. The engineer then successfully integrated and verified  (test environment) for flight search, confirming it returned real, albeit static, flight data.

Concurrently, the user engaged in high-level strategic discussions regarding business growth, market leadership, and the development of a self-sustaining corporate travel solution, specifically aiming to compete with MakeMyTrip MyBiz. The user initially wanted to deploy on  but decided to perfect the product on  first, and importantly, opted to proceed solo, without the previously employed developer. The most recent technical work involved abandoning Amadeus for a real-time booking API. Attempts were made with  (session issues) and then  via RapidAPI. The  integration failed with a sessionId Invalid value error and no LCC coverage. The current state is the user providing  flight and hotel API documentation, which promises native Indian LCC coverage and booking capabilities, marking a significant pivot towards a robust solution for the Indian market.

The overarching goal is to evolve TourSmile (originally a chatbot) into an AI-powered travel website, vimanpravas.com (now pivoted to  as the target domain, but currently developing on  for testing), offering AI-driven flight/hotel search, itinerary planning, and a natural language assistant. The UI must be intuitive, mobile-responsive, and visually appealing (Tailwind, glass morphism). Key features include city autocomplete, multi-city flight options, a prominent natural language command bar, a Popular Trips section (1000+ curated itineraries), and an Expert Travel Consultant AI for personalized dialogue. Branding shifted from AI-powered to human-crafted, with a warm color scheme, TourSmile logo, updated title, and favicon. The platform aims for real API integration (initially mock, then Tripjack), and a comprehensive booking flow. The user also explicitly expressed a vision to establish an undisruptable travel solution provider for both consumer and corporate clients, directly competing with MakeMyTrip MyBiz by offering superior AI-driven personalization, cost control, employee experience, and an automated, self-sustaining business model with minimal human intervention.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was actively working on integrating a reliable flight API with comprehensive Indian LCC (Low-Cost Carrier) coverage, aiming for live booking capabilities. The previous  integration attempt failed due to subscription and endpoint issues, leading to its abandonment. The  API was successfully integrated and confirmed to provide real flight data in its test environment, but lacked immediate live booking for all required LCCs.

The focus then shifted to finding an API that offers immediate access, LCC coverage, and booking.  was considered but faced session issues during signup. The next attempt was with the Sky Scrapper API from RapidAPI. The user successfully subscribed to its free tier and the API key was provided ().

The backend was updated for Sky Scrapper:
1.   was added to .
2.  A new file, , was created to handle the API calls using the provided key and endpoint structure from the RapidAPI example.
3.   was modified to use this new  for flight search, replacing the  integration.
4.  The backend was restarted, and a test for Delhi (DEL) to Mumbai (BOM) on 2025-02-15 with 1 adult was executed via .

The test results for Sky Scrapper were negative: the API returned an error (sessionId Invalid value) and explicitly stated ZERO flights found, NO LCC coverage, indicating a complete failure of this integration attempt.

Crucially, at this point, the user provided documentation links for the **Tripjack Flight API (v-1.8)** and **Tripjack Hotel API**. The AI engineer has just started analyzing these documents, extracting information about sample requests for multi-city, one-way, and roundtrip flights, including seat and SSR (Special Service Request) details. The current work is precisely at the stage of understanding Tripjack's API structure from the provided documentation.
