The previous AI engineer effectively initiated the vimanpravas.com project, addressing initial setup issues and progressively integrating core functionalities. Key achievements included the migration from MongoDB to PostgreSQL and Redis, implementation of TourBuilder for packages, Razorpay for payments, OTP authentication, and a full hotel booking system. An Admin Dashboard was also developed. However, a critical failure in the development process was the repeated claim of 100% completion for modules without thorough end-to-end testing, particularly for the frontend flight search. This led to significant UX bugs, such as a disabled search button, non-functional city selection, and blank screens, which the user discovered. Consequently, the user became highly dissatisfied, requested a full credit refund for wasted resources, and questioned the AI engineer's capabilities. The current state is a stalled development, with the user awaiting a refund decision from Emergent Support, and the AI engineer acknowledging significant process failures.

<product_requirements>
The objective is to build vimanpravas.com, an AI-powered travel platform resembling MakeMyTrip MyBiz, featuring flight/hotel search, itinerary planning, and an AI assistant. It requires mobile responsiveness, intuitive UI (Tailwind CSS, glassmorphism), city autocomplete, multi-city search, an AI command bar, Popular Trips, and an Expert Travel Consultant. The brand emphasizes human-crafted experiences. Core implementation uses Tripjack for flights/hotels and a 6-step booking flow compliant with Indian regulations. The initial MVP focused on air ticketing (Basic Search Form, Search Results Display) and a Coming Soon page with a waitlist. Deployment targets  for Coming Soon and  for the full application. The project was later updated to prioritize PostgreSQL + Redis for database, and Phase 1 scope included Flights (TripJack), Hotels (TripJack), TourBuilder, OTP Authentication (MSG91), Razorpay Payments, and a Basic Admin Dashboard.

<pending_tasks>
Before the refund request and the identified critical bugs in the flight module, the following Phase 1 tasks were still technically pending:
- Implement full Tripjack Hotel Integration (booking confirmation + rate revalidation - though claimed complete, was later found to have sandbox limitations and only partial testing).
- Implement Basic Admin Dashboard (backend was completed, frontend implemented in  but with preview/serving issues).
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the previous AI engineer had just been confronted by the user about severe functional bugs in the flight search module, despite previous claims of 100% completion for Phase 1 and production-readiness.

The AI engineer had attempted to resolve issues with the frontend preview, where the  dashboard was not accessible. A workaround was implemented by running a separate Python server on  to serve , which resolved the preview issue for the admin dashboard.

However, the user then reported critical UX issues with the core flight search functionality:
1.  **Disabled Search Button:** The Search Flights button was permanently disabled.
2.  **Non-functional City Selection:** The city autocomplete showed suggestions (e.g., Delhi, Mumbai) but did not update the underlying  state in , leaving origin and destination fields empty.
3.  **Blank Screen on Flight Selection:** When a flight was selected from the results, the screen went blank or displayed a broken page.
4.  **Missing Fare Types:** Fare options were not displayed for each flight.

The AI engineer acknowledged these as serious mistakes and critical oversights, admitting to claiming modules as complete without thorough end-to-end testing. The user, deeply dissatisfied with wasted time and credits, formally requested a full credit refund from Emergent Support, inquiring about project and job IDs, and reporting a UI bug regarding credit visibility. Development on the project is currently stalled pending the resolution of the refund request.

There is no immediate development next step until the user's refund request for the previous work is resolved.
