The previous AI engineer initiated work on TourSmile, an AI-powered travel platform, facing an immediate challenge: a persistent frontend JSX compilation error in . Initial debugging attempts, including fragment wrapping and structural checks, were unsuccessful. This led to a strategic pivot: the user opted for an MVP-first, incremental development approach, abandoning the direct fix of the complex  for a simpler rebuild.

Following this, the engineer successfully built a core flight search module in two phases: first, a basic form, then an enhanced hand-holding guided UX with comprehensive airport data and multi-city support. An interim request for a coming soon landing page with email capture was then prioritized. This page, including backend integration for a waitlist, was developed with refined, positive messaging and the user's logo.

The current challenge centers on deploying this coming soon page. Despite setting the  flag and performing clean builds, the page is not displaying on the target  domain, which the user clarified is already pointing to the Emergent environment with the existing (older) TourSmile version. The engineer is actively troubleshooting this build/caching issue, which prevents the updated content from being served.

The goal is to transform TourSmile into vimanpravas.com, an AI-powered travel platform offering flight/hotel search, itinerary planning, and a natural language assistant, directly competing with MakeMyTrip MyBiz for consumers and corporate clients. The UI must be mobile-responsive, intuitive, and visually appealing (Tailwind, glassmorphism), featuring city autocomplete, multi-city flight options, an AI command bar, Popular Trips, and an Expert Travel Consultant AI. Branding emphasizes human-crafted experiences. Robust API integration (Tripjack) and a comprehensive 6-step booking flow are required, with detailed fare types and advanced filtering. Indian compliance (Aadhaar/Passport, mobile, GST) is mandatory.

The development shifted to an MVP-first, incremental approach. The initial focus was the air ticketing module, broken down into smaller tasks:
1.  **Basic Search Form:** Origin/Destination, date, passengers, class, with clean, responsive UI. Enhanced to provide a hand-holding guided user experience with progressive disclosure, auto-focus, and a comprehensive airport database (Indian + International).
2.  **Search Results Display:** Clean flight cards, basic info, and a Select Flight button.
3.  **Coming Soon Page:** A professional landing page for  with a positive, action-oriented message and email capture for lead generation, to be deployed while core development continues.

-   ****: Main FastAPI application. Integrates various routers. Most recently updated to include .
-   ****: Stores API keys (Tripjack, Amadeus, etc.) and database connection.
-   ****: Python dependencies.
-   ****: Contains 20,000+ global destinations/attractions used for autocomplete. Important for the hand-holding search experience.
-   ** / **: New files for Tripjack API integration.
-   ****: **NEW FILE CREATED.** Defines FastAPI routes (, , ) for collecting and managing waitlist emails. Crucial for the coming soon page functionality.
-   ****: Main React component. Initially plagued by JSX compilation errors. Underwent major overhauls:
    -   Initial attempt at comprehensive flight search UI and 6-step booking flow.
    -   Then, reduced to a clean, minimal search form.
    -   Further refined for a guided hand-holding search experience with progressive disclosure and comprehensive airport data.
    -   **Most recently, modified to conditionally render  based on a  flag.** It was also updated to include  component and fix variable declarations.
-   ****: **NEW FILE CREATED.** A dedicated React component for the coming soon landing page, including the company logo, a positive marketing message, and an email subscription form.
-   ****: **NEW FILE CREATED.** A React component designed to display flight search results in a clean, filterable, and sortable format.
-   ****: Communication and reporting log. Used for recording test results and issue fixes.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on deploying the newly developed coming soon page to . The goal was for this page (from ) to display live on the domain, allowing the user to begin collecting emails while further development of the core flight booking module proceeded privately.

The  file was modified to conditionally render the  component based on a  flag, which was explicitly set to . A backend endpoint for email collection (, , ) was successfully created in  and integrated into .

Despite confirmation that the flag was set correctly and multiple attempts at cleaning and rebuilding the frontend, the coming soon page was not appearing on . Instead, the domain continued to display an older version of the TourSmile application. This indicates a persistent build or caching issue in the deployment environment. The engineer's last actions involved deep cleaning the build cache, forcing the  rendering, and inspecting the built  file, which still showed the old content. The immediate nuance is understanding why the build process isn't correctly packaging the updated  and  for deployment.
