The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on TourSmile (vimanpravas.com), transitioning it from an MVP to a feature-rich travel platform. Initially, the focus was on resolving deployment issues and enhancing UI/UX. A major bug involving Popular Trips display and clickability was fully resolved, making the section interactive with detailed itinerary modals. Subsequent efforts concentrated on integrating real-time flight and hotel APIs. Multiple attempts were made with  and , but these services proved unreliable, leading to a pivot to  for flight data. The current challenge revolves around correctly configuring  due to marketplace-specific API endpoints, despite the API key being valid. The engineer consistently debugged, adapted to user feedback, and documented progress, ensuring a production-ready application that currently relies on robust mockups for flight and hotel searches while real API issues are resolved.

The goal was to transform TourSmile (toursmile.in), initially a chatbot, into an AI-powered travel website. Key features include AI-driven flight search, hotel recommendations, itinerary planning, and a natural language assistant, all supported by a comprehensive booking flow (starting with mock data, transitioning to real APIs like Tripjack). The UI required an intuitive, mobile-responsive, visually appealing design (using Tailwind, glass morphism) with city autocomplete, multi-city flight options, and a prominent command bar. Branding shifted from AI-powered to human-crafted, adopting a warm color scheme and TourSmile logo, removing Made with Emergent branding. Later enhancements included a Popular Trips section (1000+ curated itineraries, 4-15 nights), an Expert Travel Consultant AI for personalized dialogue (budget, hotel category, timing), a 10-second homepage demo video, and updates to the website title and favicon. The ultimate aim is a user-friendly, production-ready platform for travel bookings and consultations.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was actively working on integrating real-time flight data using the AeroDataBox API. The user had provided an API key () and confirmed subscription via API.Market marketplace.

The backend code was updated:
1.   was added to .
2.  A new file, , was created to handle the AeroDataBox API calls.
3.   was modified to use this new service, replacing the previous  integration.
4.  The  was also adjusted to lazily load the API key from the environment, similar to previous fixes for other APIs, to ensure it's available post-server startup.

Upon testing, the API key was successfully loaded and the AeroDataBox API was being called. However, the API returned a  error with the message You are not subscribed to this API. The root cause identified was a mismatch in the API endpoint; the code was using a generic AeroDataBox endpoint, but the user's subscription was specifically through the  marketplace, which requires a different base URL () and authentication method (likely tied to API.Market's standard). The current work is precisely at the point of correcting this endpoint and authentication.

<optional_next_step>
Update the  to use the correct API.Market base URL and authentication method.
