The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the deployment of the TourSmile application (rebranded as vimanpravas.com) to an Interserver VPS after encountering incompatibility issues with ASP.NET shared hosting on the main domain. The core challenge involved deploying a React frontend and FastAPI backend.

The trajectory details a persistent struggle with Nginx configuration and deployment. Initially, Nginx configuration was incorrectly pasted into the shell. Subsequently, despite multiple attempts to install, start, enable, and configure Nginx, the web server consistently returned a 403 Forbidden error. This issue was not resolved, even after verifying file permissions,  readability, and trying different Nginx configurations. There are inconsistencies regarding Nginx's installation status (reported as installed, then not found, then installed again, and environment switching between Ubuntu and Debian), suggesting potential environment resets or ephemeral containers between user interactions. The backend is confirmed to be running via PM2, but the frontend cannot be served.

The goal is to evolve TourSmile into vimanpravas.com, an AI-powered travel platform to rival MakeMyTrip MyBiz. It will feature flight/hotel search, itinerary planning, and an AI assistant. Key UI/UX elements include mobile responsiveness, an intuitive interface, modern design (Tailwind, glassmorphism), city autocomplete, multi-city flight options, an AI command bar, Popular Trips, and an Expert Travel Consultant AI. The brand emphasizes human-crafted experiences. Critical aspects include robust API integration (Tripjack for flights/hotels) and a comprehensive 6-step booking flow with advanced filtering and Indian compliance (Aadhaar/Passport, mobile, GST). The development strategy was MVP-first, focusing initially on air ticketing (Basic Search Form, Search Results Display) and a Coming Soon page for lead generation and waitlist integration.

The application uses a standard full-stack setup:
- ****: This is the core FastAPI application.
    - **Summary of importance:** It serves as the central API endpoint, handling waitlist subscriptions, Amadeus flight searches, popular trips data, and booking creation. It also integrates MongoDB for data persistence and a custom email service for notifications.
    - **Changes Made:** Updated to include explicit routes and logic for waitlist and booking, integrates , Amadeus API, and SMTP email service. Pydantic models are defined for data validation.
- ****: Environment variables for the backend.
    - **Summary of importance:** Holds sensitive API keys and credentials, ensuring they are not hardcoded.
    - **Changes Made:** Created and populated with , , , SMTP details, Amadeus API keys, and Tripjack API details.
- ****: Python dependencies for the backend.
    - **Summary of importance:** Ensures all necessary Python libraries are installed for the FastAPI application to run.
    - **Changes Made:** Populated with , , , , , , , , , , and .
- ****: Main React component for routing.
    - **Summary of importance:** Manages the main application flow, switching between Coming Soon and the full booking system based on a URL parameter.
    - **Changes Made:** Modified to control the display of  page via a  URL parameter, with  set to  for beta deployment.
- ****: The directory for the React frontend build.
    - **Summary of importance:** This is where the compiled React application (HTML, CSS, JS) resides for Nginx to serve to users. All frontend source files (, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ) have been recreated and yarn install v1.22.22

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the primary task was to deploy the complete TourSmile application (air ticketing module) to  on a newly provisioned Interserver VPS (IP ). The VPS setup included:
- System updates, Node.js 20, Python 3.11, pip, venv.
- MongoDB 7.0 installed and enabled.
- Nginx installed (though its consistent presence and functionality have been a recurring issue).
- PM2 and  installed globally.
- Certbot installed.
- Application directories (, ) created.
- Backend  and  created and populated.
- Backend  (FastAPI app) created and dependencies installed.
- Backend successfully started as a daemonized process using PM2 ().

The main hurdle has been the Nginx web server. Initially, the user incorrectly pasted the Nginx configuration directly into the terminal, causing errors. After this, multiple attempts were made to ensure Nginx was correctly installed, configured, and running. Despite Nginx reporting syntax is ok and test is successful, and being seemingly started and reloaded, all  requests to  or the VPS IP  consistently result in a HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden error. This indicates that Nginx is running but is refusing to serve the content, likely due to a subtle configuration issue, missing index file reference, or persistent permission problems that were not resolved by  commands. The environment also showed inconsistencies (e.g.,  not working, switching between Ubuntu and Debian package sources), making debugging challenging.

The React frontend application's source code has been completely recreated on the VPS under  and the production build (yarn run v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command.) has been successfully generated into . The  file within this build directory has been verified to exist and be readable by the  user (Nginx's default user).

The application is currently in a state where the backend is operational on the VPS, the frontend code is built and present on the VPS, but Nginx is failing to serve the frontend content, blocking the complete deployment.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to troubleshoot and resolve the Nginx 403 Forbidden error to successfully serve the React frontend.
