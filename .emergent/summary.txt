The previous AI engineer successfully deployed the TourSmile application (renamed vimanpravas.com) on a new Interserver VPS. The initial major hurdle was a persistent 403 Forbidden Nginx error for the frontend. This was meticulously debugged and found to be a JavaScript build issue ( concatenation) in  and a missing  package for the frontend. After fixing these, the frontend and backend became fully functional. The focus then shifted to integrating the Tripjack API. Authentication with the provided API key was achieved after identifying and correcting the API's single-key usage. Currently, the main challenge is implementing the actual Tripjack flight search due to issues with reading the provided documentation files, despite having samples and knowing authentication works.

The overarching goal is to transform TourSmile into vimanpravas.com, an AI-powered travel platform akin to MakeMyTrip MyBiz. This platform will offer comprehensive flight and hotel search, advanced itinerary planning, and an AI assistant. Key user experience elements include full mobile responsiveness, an intuitive UI with modern design (Tailwind CSS, glassmorphism), city autocomplete, multi-city flight search capabilities, an AI command bar, Popular Trips suggestions, and an Expert Travel Consultant AI. The brand emphasizes human-crafted travel experiences. Core implementation relies on robust API integrations, primarily with Tripjack for flights and hotels, alongside a detailed 6-step booking flow accommodating Indian compliance requirements (Aadhaar/Passport, mobile, GST). The development began with an MVP approach, initially focusing on air ticketing (Basic Search Form, Search Results Display) and a Coming Soon page for lead generation, integrated with a waitlist. The deployment strategy involves  showing the Coming Soon page, while  hosts the full working application.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the primary task was to resolve deployment issues on . Initially, the frontend was inaccessible, returning an Nginx 403 Forbidden error. Through investigation, it was discovered that the root cause was not Nginx permissions, but a JavaScript syntax error in the React build (specifically, a malformed template string for the  in  on line 20) and the  package not being installed.

The  file was modified to change  to , and  was installed. The frontend was then successfully rebuilt and restarted via Supervisor. This resolved the deployment issue, making both the Coming Soon page and the full booking interface (via  parameter) accessible.

The work then shifted to improving the backend's 77.8% test success rate, which was attributed to the Tripjack API using mock data. The user provided an API key and confirmed the need for IP whitelisting. The system's public IP () was identified for whitelisting. The  was updated in . Initial authentication attempts failed, but the  was modified to use the single provided API key directly for authentication, which succeeded.

Currently, the Tripjack API authentication is working perfectly. However, the subsequent flight search calls are failing (), indicating that the parameters for the actual flight search API are incorrect or incomplete. The user has provided comprehensive Tripjack API documentation (24 unique files), but the AI engineer has encountered difficulties in programmatically reading/crawling these documents (PDF, DOCX, XLSX files) to extract the necessary API specifications for implementing the flight search, though some sample text files were successfully read. The immediate next step is to parse and understand this documentation.
