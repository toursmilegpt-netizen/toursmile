The AI engineer effectively addressed complex challenges in transforming TourSmile into vimanpravas.com. Initially, a critical Nginx 403 error for the frontend was resolved by fixing a JavaScript build issue in  and installing the  package. The focus then shifted to integrating the Tripjack API. Authentication was successfully implemented after correctly using the provided API key.

A significant portion of the work involved meticulously debugging and fixing the Tripjack flight search functionality. This included resolving a , removing duplicate search methods, correcting the frontend's display logic (fixing  parameter issues, adding results components), and critically, rectifying the price parsing in  to correctly extract real flight prices from the Tripjack API response. Branding was also updated to incorporate the TourSmile logo.

Currently, the application's air ticket module is fully functional and production-ready. The immediate challenge is deployment to the user's Interserver VPS. After resolving keyboard input issues in the VPS console with Interserver support, the user successfully logged in, and the next step is to guide them through the server setup. The user also raised valid concerns about duplicated effort and credits spent due to previous incomplete work, which was documented for Emergent Support.

The goal is to build vimanpravas.com, an AI-powered travel platform similar to MakeMyTrip MyBiz, offering comprehensive flight/hotel search, itinerary planning, and an AI assistant. It requires full mobile responsiveness, intuitive UI (Tailwind CSS, glassmorphism), city autocomplete, multi-city search, an AI command bar, Popular Trips, and an Expert Travel Consultant. The brand emphasizes human-crafted experiences. Core implementation uses Tripjack for flights/hotels and a 6-step booking flow for Indian compliance. The MVP focuses on air ticketing (Basic Search Form, Search Results Display) and a Coming Soon page for lead generation with a waitlist. Deployment strategy is  showing Coming Soon and  hosting the full application. So far, the air ticket module (search, results, basic booking flow) and the waitlist functionality are implemented and tested, with branding updated to TourSmile.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the focus was on deploying the fully functional air ticket booking module to the user's Interserver VPS. The application's backend (FastAPI) is running at  and the frontend (React) is served by  from . All services are managed by Supervisor.

The air ticket module is now robust:
1.  **Backend Integration:** Tripjack API authentication is working, and flight search calls correctly retrieve real flight data, including accurate pricing (resolved the ₹0 price issue by fixing parsing in ).
2.  **Frontend Functionality:** The main application interface, including the flight search form, city autocomplete, and results display, is fully functional. Critical UI/UX issues, such as the search button being disabled (due to form validation) and flight results not showing (due to missing components and price parsing errors), have been resolved. The  parameter now correctly shows the full booking interface.
3.  **Branding:** The TourSmile logo has been successfully integrated into the frontend.

The deployment challenge arose when the user reported issues accessing the Interserver VPS console (keyboard input not working). After creating a support ticket with Interserver, the issue was resolved by an Interserver restart, confirming console access. The user also learned that DirectAdmin cannot be installed on their Ubuntu 24 VPS without an OS reinstall. The current state is that the user has successfully logged into the VPS console via View Desktop and is waiting for guidance on the next command-line steps to proceed with deployment, specifically asking for a summary due to the complexity.
