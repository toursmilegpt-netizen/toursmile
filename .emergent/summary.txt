The previous AI engineer initiated vimanpravas.com, migrating from MongoDB to PostgreSQL/Redis and implementing core features like TourBuilder, Razorpay, OTP, hotel booking, and an Admin Dashboard. A critical failure was claiming 100% completion for modules without thorough end-to-end testing, leading to severe frontend flight search bugs (disabled search button, non-functional city selection, blank screens, zero prices). This led to user dissatisfaction, refund requests, and stalled development.

The current AI engineer's work began by fixing these core flight search issues through extensive debugging, systematic testing, and rectifying state management in  and , eventually achieving a 100% functional flight search to PNR generation. Subsequently, the focus shifted to iterative UX improvements: date picker size, results page layout, fare option details, user guidance, glowing search button, and a comprehensive UI redesign. A major turning point was the user's request for a multi-product homepage mockup, which then evolved to include multi-city search, dynamic date logic, and refined feature presentation. The latest phase involves implementing potentially missing features for a competitive platform, with Razorpay keys pending for full payment flow testing.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build vimanpravas.com, an AI-powered travel platform similar to MakeMyTrip MyBiz, offering flight/hotel search, itinerary planning, and an AI assistant. Key requirements include mobile responsiveness, intuitive UI (Tailwind CSS, glassmorphism), city autocomplete, multi-city search, an AI command bar, Popular Trips, and an Expert Travel Consultant. The platform emphasizes human-crafted experiences, uses Tripjack for flight/hotel APIs, and a 6-step booking flow compliant with Indian regulations. Initial MVP focused on air ticketing (Basic Search Form, Search Results Display), a Coming Soon page with a waitlist, and later prioritized PostgreSQL + Redis. Phase 1 scope included Flights (TripJack), Hotels (TripJack), TourBuilder, OTP Authentication (MSG91), Razorpay Payments, and a Basic Admin Dashboard. Recent updates include enhanced UX for date picker, results page, navigation, multi-city functionality, and dynamic form logic.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had successfully implemented and tested a comprehensive multi-city flight search with smart date logic, proportional sizing, and a refined, minimalistic UI based on user feedback. The system now supports one-way, round-trip, and multi-city itineraries, with dynamic date fields, integrated passenger/class selection, and preferences like Non-Stop, Student, and Senior Citizen. The homepage was redesigned with a larger logo, prominent navigation buttons styled like elegant cards, and a classy hero section highlighting Instant Search, Secure Booking, and Easy Booking. The explicit click the glowing button instruction was removed, favoring pure visual guidance. The AI engineer performed a comprehensive feature audit, identifying several potentially missing features for a competitive OTA platform. The user requested to implement all potentially missing feature changes, and the AI engineer has just begun Phase 1: Enhanced Search Features by starting to implement **Time Preferences** in the search form, while awaiting Razorpay test keys from the user.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to implement Time Preferences (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night) for the flight search form.
