The previous AI engineer successfully launched the TourSmile application from MVP to a comprehensive flight booking system, known as vimanpravas.com. Initial hurdles included frontend deployment issues due to development mode builds and branding removal. The core development focused on a 4-step flight booking flow, including flight selection, passenger details, Razorpay payment, and confirmation. An email notification system, initially SendGrid, pivoted to Interserver SMTP for efficiency, and included IP-based location tracking. The current major challenge involves deploying the complete system to . This transition faced complex DNS resolution issues, aggravated by confusion between GoDaddy and Interserver DNS management. Ultimately, a critical discovery of ASP.NET shared hosting incompatibility led to a strategic shift towards deploying on a new Interserver VPS. The current state is mid-VPS setup, with most system dependencies installed, and the immediate task is to correctly save the Nginx configuration file.

The overarching goal is to transform TourSmile into vimanpravas.com, an AI-powered travel platform designed to compete with MakeMyTrip MyBiz. The platform aims to offer comprehensive flight/hotel search, itinerary planning, and a natural language AI assistant. Key UI/UX requirements include mobile responsiveness, an intuitive interface, modern aesthetics (Tailwind, glassmorphism), city autocomplete, multi-city flight options, an AI command bar, Popular Trips, and an Expert Travel Consultant AI. The branding emphasizes human-crafted experiences. Robust API integration (specifically Tripjack for flights/hotels) and a detailed 6-step booking flow with advanced filtering and Indian compliance (Aadhaar/Passport, mobile, GST) are mandatory. The development adopted an MVP-first, incremental strategy, prioritizing the air ticketing module: Basic Search Form, Search Results Display, and a professional Coming Soon Page with email capture for lead generation and waitlist integration.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the primary focus was on deploying the complete air ticketing module to a subdomain (). Initial attempts revealed the main domain's DNS was managed on Interserver (not GoDaddy), and there was an issue with  resolving to an incorrect Microsoft IIS server IP, despite correct A records on Interserver's DNS manager.

Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the user's main domain was pointing to ASP.NET Web Hosting on Interserver, which is incompatible with the React+FastAPI stack. This led to a critical pivot: deploying the application to a newly provisioned Interserver VPS.

The VPS () was successfully created and configured for India timezone. The deployment process to the VPS has initiated, covering:

2.  **Node.js Installation**: Node.js 20 installed.
3.  **Python Installation**: Python 3.11, pip, and venv installed.
4.  **MongoDB Installation**: MongoDB 7.0 installed and service started/enabled.
5.  **Nginx Installation**: Nginx web server installed.
6.  **Process Managers**: PM2 and  installed globally using npm.
7.  **SSL Tools**: Certbot installed.
8.  **Application Directories**:  and  created on the VPS.
9.  **Backend Environment File**:  was created and populated with production API keys and SMTP credentials.
10. **Backend Requirements File**:  was created and dependencies installed in a virtual environment ().
11. **Backend Server File**:  was created and populated with the complete FastAPI application code.
12. **Backend Service Test**: The FastAPI backend was successfully tested by running  locally on the VPS (then stopped).
13. **Backend Service Start (PM2)**: The backend was successfully started as a daemonized process using PM2 ().

The immediate task being worked on is **configuring Nginx**. The user attempted to paste the Nginx configuration directly into the terminal instead of the  editor, leading to command not found errors.

The current state is that the VPS is ready with all necessary system components and the backend running via PM2. The next step is to correctly save the Nginx configuration.
