The AI engineer's work on TourSmile pivoted from initial UI fixes and unreliable API integrations to establishing a robust AI-powered travel platform. Key challenges included persistent API issues (HotelAPI.co, FlightAPI.io, AeroDataBox, Kiwi.com, Sky Scrapper) which led to the adoption of Tripjack. Concurrently, strategic discussions with the user emphasized competing with MakeMyTrip MyBiz through AI-driven personalization and corporate solutions. The core of the recent work involved integrating Tripjack APIs (flight and hotel), setting up a comprehensive booking flow, and enhancing the frontend with advanced filtering and AI-driven search. A significant ongoing hurdle is a persistent frontend JSX compilation error in , preventing deployment. The user has explicitly prioritized fixing this error and building correctly, even over immediate revenue generation, while providing Razorpay test credentials. The last interaction confirms the user's commitment to debugging the existing advanced codebase rather than reverting to a simpler version.

The objective is to transform TourSmile into vimanpravas.com (target ), an AI-powered travel website. It aims to offer AI-driven flight/hotel search, itinerary planning, and a natural language assistant, competing directly with MakeMyTrip MyBiz for both consumer and corporate clients. The UI must be mobile-responsive, intuitive, and visually appealing (Tailwind, glassmorphism), featuring city autocomplete, multi-city flight options, a prominent AI command bar, Popular Trips (1000+ itineraries), and an Expert Travel Consultant AI. Branding emphasizes human-crafted experiences. The platform requires robust API integration (currently targeting Tripjack for real bookings, previously using mock data/Amadeus) and a comprehensive booking flow with detailed fare types and advanced filtering. User input also stressed ease of use, mandatory Aadhaar/Passport names, mobile numbers, and GST details for Indian compliance. The current focus is on building a high-quality, fully functional air ticketing module.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in a critical debugging effort to resolve a persistent frontend JSX compilation error in . This error (Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag or Unexpected token {) prevents the application's UI from loading, making the product unusable.

Earlier, the engineer successfully integrated a backend endpoint for AI travel query parsing () and established the full backend structure for Tripjack Flight and Hotel APIs. The backend testing confirmed these are working for mock data. The frontend  was extensively modified to include:
1.  An enhanced flight results display with advanced filtering (price, airline, time, duration, stops) and fare type exploration.
2.  A comprehensive 6-step flight booking flow architecture (passenger details, seat selection, payment, confirmation).
3.  Initial AI-driven natural language search field and progressive field highlighting.

The user provided Razorpay test credentials, signaling readiness for payment integration. However, the user explicitly prioritized fixing the frontend JSX error and building a solid, high-quality foundation over immediate revenue generation or rushing the process. The immediate work involves systematically debugging and fixing this stubborn JSX error, tracing the JSX hierarchy to find unmatched tags or uncontained adjacent elements, with confidence that it is solvable.

Continue debugging the persistent frontend JSX compilation error in  as per the user's explicit request.
