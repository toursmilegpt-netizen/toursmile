The trajectory describes a complex, iterative development process for TourSmile, transitioning from initial backend integration debugging to extensive frontend UI/UX refinement and deployment infrastructure setup, and ultimately pivoting to Emergent as the sole full-stack executor. Initially, the AI engineer successfully fixed backend flight search API issues and verified existing integrations. A significant portion of the work then focused on designing and deploying a static Coming Soon page, involving multiple rounds of UI/UX feedback (logo, tagline, responsive breakpoints, feature boxes) and intricate, non-technical guidance for server setup (Plesk, DirectAdmin, DNS, SSL) on InterServer. The Coming Soon page was visually polished and deployed. Following this, the collaboration with a third-party frontend partner (Same.new) was established and then unexpectedly terminated, leading Emergent to take over full frontend development. The latest task involves replicating an ixigo-style flight search input experience, with an instant delivery of a functional autocomplete component previewed in the current message. The overall journey highlights a strong emphasis on pixel-perfect UI, mobile responsiveness, and clear, step-by-step communication for infrastructure tasks.

The TourSmile platform (vimanpravas.com) is envisioned as an AI-powered travel solution for flights, hotels, itinerary planning, and AI assistance, emphasizing mobile responsiveness and a modern UI. Its MVP included air ticketing and waitlist features on PostgreSQL/Redis. The initial phase focused on Tripjack Flights/Hotels, TourBuilder, OTP (MSG91), Razorpay Payments, and an Admin Dashboard, targeting 100% UI/UX accuracy for the homepage. Subsequent development extensively refined the flight search form, incorporating Priority 1/2 features and numerous design iterations (Figma, Apple-inspired, world-class premium white theme). This involved precise control over typography, spacing, colors, shadows, and responsive breakpoints. A critical, immediate request was to deploy a static Coming Soon page to toursmile.in, requiring significant iterative UI refinements (logo, tagline, box proportions, spacing) and non-technical server setup guidance. More recently, Emergent was tasked to solely execute the Flights module, including Home (search form, autocomplete, passenger/calendar overlays, options), Flight Results (cards, filters, sort), Flight Booking (forms), and Payment (Razorpay integration), adhering to an Apple-inspired and ixigo-style UX/UI.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully deployed the Coming Soon static page to  on InterServer, navigating complex DNS, SSL (Let's Encrypt), and DirectAdmin setup and troubleshooting. This involved multiple iterations of UI refinement based on user feedback, ultimately yielding a visually polished, responsive page.

Subsequently, the project scope shifted dramatically, with Emergent (the current AI engineer) becoming the sole full-stack developer after a third-party frontend partner (Same.new) was disengaged. The current focus is on building the Flights module v1, adhering to a comprehensive product brief that emphasizes an Apple-inspired and ixigo-style user experience.

The most immediate task was to implement an ixigo-style From/To autocomplete feature for instant delivery. This involved:
1.  Creating  to define  ().
2.  Creating  for the styling of the autocomplete components, including responsive adjustments for mobile.
3.  Creating  which contains the core JavaScript logic for:
    *   Fetching airport suggestions from the  endpoint (which was recently exposed by the backend).
    *   Implementing client-side caching, popular defaults (PNQ, BOM, DEL, BLR), and a fallback curated list.
    *   Handling input debounce (260ms), in-flight request aborts, and keyboard navigation.
    *   Managing UI elements like clear () buttons, swap () buttons, and rendering popular/recent/matched sections.
    *   Enabling a sticky Search Flights button that activates upon valid From/To selection.
4.  Modifying  (specifically  for preview) to include the new CSS and JS files and to embed the new HTML structure for the From/To inputs, swap button, direct flights toggle, and search button.

The AI engineer has just provided a live preview of this ixigo-style autocomplete demo page (), demonstrating its functionality across desktop and mobile.

<optional_next_step>
Apply the newly developed ixigo-style autocomplete component to the main homepage's flight search form and wire the search button to the existing backend flight search handler.
