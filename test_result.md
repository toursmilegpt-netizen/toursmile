# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Send valid authorization token. Either token is invalid or it's expired'. ❌ Credential Issue - Current .env has user credentials (user_id, email, password) but Tripjack API requires appKey and appSecret for token generation. ❌ Backend Integration - Backend authentication fails due to missing proper API credentials. ❌ Flight Search - All searches fall back to mock data, no real Tripjack data accessible. ✅ IP Whitelisting - IP 34.121.6.206 is NOT blocked, basic connectivity works. CRITICAL ISSUE: We have staging user credentials but need API developer credentials (appKey/appSecret) to generate authentication tokens.

CRITICAL SUCCESS: The Amadeus integration is working perfectly with user's real credentials. Delhi-Mumbai flights now show REAL AMADEUS DATA from their test environment instead of mock data.

    message: "🎉 DEPLOYMENT ISSUE SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVED! Fixed critical deployment configuration issue preventing the ComingSoon page from displaying on live domain. ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Frontend was running in development mode (yarn start) instead of serving production build, causing disconnect between localhost:3000 (development) and live domain expectations (static build files). SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: ✅ Updated supervisor configuration from 'yarn start' to 'serve -s build' for production static file serving. ✅ Installed 'serve' package globally for static file hosting. ✅ Rebuilt frontend with latest ComingSoon component changes. ✅ Restarted frontend service with new configuration. ✅ Verified production build now serves ComingSoon page correctly with TourSmile logo, email capture form, and professional design. VERIFICATION COMPLETE: ComingSoon component now rendering correctly from production build with proper HTTP headers indicating static file serving instead of development server. The coming soon page is ready for deployment on vimanpravas.com domain with full email capture functionality working through the waitlist API endpoints."
