    -message: "üêõ CALENDAR CLOSING BUG INVESTIGATION COMPLETED: Confirmed and analyzed the calendar not closing after date selection issue. **BUG CONFIRMED:** ‚ùå Calendar remains visible after clicking date numbers ‚ùå Calendar doesn't close when clicking outside ‚ùå Manual button click doesn't close calendar ‚úÖ Date selection works correctly (date is selected and displayed) ‚úÖ handleDateClick function is being called ‚úÖ setShowCalendar(false) is being executed **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:** The issue appears to be that the calendar state is not updating the DOM properly despite setShowCalendar(false) being called. This suggests either: 1) React state update batching/timing issues 2) Multiple calendar instances causing conflicts 3) CSS positioning interfering with event handling 4) Component re-rendering after state change **ATTEMPTED FIXES:** ‚úÖ Added proper calendarRef to calendar container ‚úÖ Removed aggressive CSS fixed positioning ‚úÖ Added manuallyClosing flag to prevent auto-reopen conflicts ‚úÖ Added setTimeout for state updates ‚úÖ Added debug logging (confirmed function calls) ‚úÖ Tried button click approach **CURRENT STATUS:** Date selection functionality works perfectly, but calendar UI state is not properly closing. This is a visual/UI state management issue rather than a functional data issue. **RECOMMENDATION:** This appears to be a React state update timing issue. The calendar closing functionality needs further investigation into component lifecycle and state management."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

This is the core issue preventing meaningful flight selection. The backend API integration is perfect, response structure matches frontend expectations, but the Tripjack price parsing is broken - all flights show ‚Çπ0 instead of actual prices.

Comprehensive testing of all 5 success criteria from review request reveals COMPLETE DATE PICKER IMPLEMENTATION FAILURE: ‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUE 1: One-Way Trip Shows 0 Date Pickers (Expected: EXACTLY 1) - No date picker fields found when One Way button is clicked. ‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUE 2: Round-Trip Shows 1 Date Picker (Expected: EXACTLY 2) - Missing return date picker for round-trip bookings. ‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUE 3: Multi-City Shows 2 Date Pickers (Expected: Inline per segment) - Not showing proper inline date pickers for each flight segment. ‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUE 4: Date Picker Functionality Completely Broken - No date picker buttons found, calendar dropdown cannot be accessed, month navigation unavailable, date selection impossible. ‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUE 5: Complete User Flow Partially Working - Mumbai‚ÜíDelhi search executes and shows 34 flight results, but without proper date selection capability. üéØ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: The deployed application is NOT using the GuidedSearchForm component described in review request. Instead, it's showing a completely different, simplified form layout that lacks the proper SimpleDatePicker components and date picker functionality. The current implementation has basic city selection and search capability but is missing the core date picker infrastructure required for error-free MVP. ‚ùå SUCCESS RATE: 0/5 SUCCESS CRITERIA MET (0% success rate). URGENT PRIORITY: Deploy the correct GuidedSearchForm implementation with proper SimpleDatePicker components to achieve the error-free MVP goal."ETAILED ANALYSIS: ‚ùå MISSING COMPONENTS: GuidedSearchForm with progressive disclosure, SimpleDatePicker with proper calendar functionality (üìÖ emoji buttons), Enhanced PassengerSelector with Adults/Children/Infants dropdowns, Enhanced autocomplete with click dropdown behavior. ‚ùå DATE PICKER ISSUES: One-Way shows 0 date pickers (expected 1), Round-Trip shows limited date picker (expected 2 with departure + return), Multi-City shows basic date pickers but calendar functionality is limited. ‚úÖ WHAT WORKS: Basic flight search form, Simple trip type toggles, Basic city autocomplete (partial), Search execution with 'Searching Best Flights...' loading, Backend integration functional. üéØ ROOT CAUSE: The current deployment appears to be an older or different version of the application, not the enhanced GuidedSearchForm with SimpleDatePicker components mentioned in the review request.

        comment: "üö® CRITICAL DATE PICKER IMPLEMENTATION FAILURE - FINAL MVP VERIFICATION FAILED! Comprehensive testing of the date picker fix completed with 42.9% success rate (3/7 tests passed). CRITICAL FINDINGS: ‚ùå ONE-WAY TRIP: Shows 0 date pickers instead of 1 - Complete absence of date selection functionality. ‚ùå ROUND-TRIP: Shows 1 date picker instead of 2 - Missing return date picker component. ‚ùå AUTOCOMPLETE FUNCTIONALITY: Completely non-functional - dropdown not appearing on click. ‚ùå PASSENGER SELECTION: Button not found - missing passenger selection interface. ‚úÖ MULTI-CITY: Working correctly with inline date pickers per segment (2 segments, 3 date elements). ‚úÖ FORM VALIDATION & SEARCH: Working properly - search executes successfully. ‚úÖ MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS: Working well on 390x844 viewport. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The current implementation appears to be using a simplified form that does not match the complex GuidedSearchForm component from App.js code. The SimpleDatePicker React component is not being rendered (hasSimpleDatePicker: false, hasGuidedForm: false). The form HTML lacks proper date input elements (type='date': false, date labels: false for One-Way). CRITICAL IMPACT: The MVP is NOT production-ready due to fundamental date picker failures. Users cannot select departure dates for One-Way trips and cannot select return dates for Round-Trip bookings, making the core flight booking functionality unusable. URGENT FIXES NEEDED: 1) Implement proper SimpleDatePicker component rendering for One-Way and Round-Trip modes, 2) Fix autocomplete dropdown functionality, 3) Add passenger selection interface, 4) Ensure GuidedSearchForm component is properly mounted and functional."E UPDATES VERIFIED - 'Secure Booking' correctly replaces 'Best Prices' in key features section.

Segment removal works correctly and form validation updates appropriately. ‚úÖ CRITICAL TEST 6: FORM VALIDATION - Search button correctly disabled when form incomplete, enables when all segments filled. Date validation ensures subsequent flights are after previous ones. ‚úÖ CRITICAL TEST 7: UI/UX QUALITY - Segment headers show proper labels, visual separation with borders between segments, compact layout works properly. Mobile responsiveness confirmed on 390x844 viewport. ‚úÖ CRITICAL TEST 8: MAXIMUM FLIGHT LIMIT - 6-flight maximum enforced correctly, 'Add Another City' button hidden when limit reached.
